Bootstrap:
-Saas is a css preprocessor which allow to edit css variables (change btn colors or anything you want) so download bootstrap source files then you can customize the classes as you want
 
    NAVBAR:

-navbar-expand to make the navbar responsive and we can choose any size we want 
lg for large
md for medium 
small for sm
extra small is by default 
when saying navbar-expand-lg means keep expanded at large when getting to md or small change it if it was navbar-expand-md it will stay expanded till it reaches small
-navbar-expand-lg: Expands the navbar on large screens and above, collapses on medium and smaller screens.

-for changing colors use bg-(color) you can see the colors defined in bootstrap in documentation where you enter in customize then colors to access them 

-for first element inside navbar use navbar-brand that would typically link to home page

-for the other links present in navbar use for div class collapse navbar-collapse 
collapse: This class makes the content collapsible (hidden by default on smaller screens).
navbar-collapse: This class applies the specific styles for collapsing content within the navbar.

-ms-auto : stands for margin start auto where the element that get this class will be aligned to the far most right of the container 

-class="navbar-toggler": This class styles the button as a toggle button (often a "hamburger" icon) that is used to expand or collapse the navbar content on smaller screens.

type="button": Specifies the button type as a button, ensuring it acts as a clickable button.

data-bs-toggle="collapse": This attribute triggers the collapse functionality provided by Bootstrapâ€™s JavaScript. When the button is clicked, it will toggle the collapse of the targeted element.

FIX NABVAR: to let the navbar fixed on top when giving nav bar class fixed-top we get a problem where in top it will overlap 
so use css to get body::before 

    PADDING: 

pt is for padding top and you define how much padding by pt-n 
pb id for padding bottom
px is for padding on x axis (left and right)
py is for padding on y axis (top and bottom)
p-n alone is for overall padding in all directions
NOTE: same for margin but use m instead of p     and same for gap but use g 

    FLEXBOX:

-class d-flex represent a flex box 
with it we can use classes justify-content , flex-row , flex-column and align-items
-d-sm-flex: Flexbox is applied on small (sm) screens and larger (md, lg, xl, xxl).
Below small (xs): No flexbox, uses the default display behavior.

    IMAGES:

-img-fluid sets the max-width to 100% and its height to auto
-w-50 to set the width to 50%
-

    TEXT-STYLE:

-to change text color use class text-colorname(according to colors defined in bootstrap)
-class lead will make text bigger
-we can use class of h1 or other headings to make the text in div bigger
-The fw-bold class in Bootstrap is used to apply bold font weight to text, making it appear bolder.

    BOXES:

-use row to contain the columns 
NOTE: if you want on smaller screens to get the cols stacked on each other you need to have the class as col-md so that anything smaller than md wouldn't get class col and thus boxes are stacked under each other 

    CARDS:

-we first have wrapping class card
-inside it we have class card-body


    BOOTSTRAP ICONS:

-first copy the cdn
-in an i tag use bi to access icons present in the manual


    BOOTSTRAP GRID SYSTEM:

-consist of 12 rows and 12 cols (col-md-6 means we want to take 6 columns on meduim screens)
    
    LISTS:

-start the list with class list-group and use list-group-flush to to style a list group such that it removes the default borders 
and padding around the list items and makes the list items sit flush against the container (such as a card)
-then use class list-group-item for li this class applies a border to each list item, creating the line under each item

GENERAL NOTES:
-use the following link to get random people portfolio pictures using an api 
https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/11.jpg
-to generate a map use account.mapbox.com first go to download sdk from web then copy the cdn 
then at next copy everything in a script tag
then add under map add a value called center and give it a number to represent the location you want
- bi-arrow-up on its own when clicked will take you to the begining of the web page
